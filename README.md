analyse and reverse engineer the activation record


create a php script that was responsible for generating the activation record
the script must be able to generate the full activation record including the certificates 
we can use ideviceinfo to extract idevice specific data used within the activation record 

analyse the certificates one by one and implement the functions that generated them to our php script
